# Static Code Analysis Lab

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of static code analysis tools (Pylint, Bandit, Flake8) to identify and fix code quality, security, and style issues in a Python inventory management system.

## Lab Objectives
- Apply static code analysis to identify programming issues
- Fix security vulnerabilities and code quality problems
- Improve code style and documentation
- Understand the role of static analysis in software development

## Tools Used
### Pylint
- **Purpose**: Code quality analysis and bug detection
- **Focus**: Logical errors, code smells, design issues

### Bandit  
- **Purpose**: Security vulnerability detection
- **Focus**: Dangerous functions, security anti-patterns

### Flake8
- **Purpose**: Style guide enforcement
- **Focus**: PEP 8 compliance, syntax issues
